      "content": "1) Is JavaScript a multithreaded language? \nNo, JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one command at a time. However, it can handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await. \n\n2) What is the difference between null and undefined? \nNull is an assignment value that represents no value, while undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. \n\n3) Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript. \nA closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This allows for data encapsulation and private variables."
